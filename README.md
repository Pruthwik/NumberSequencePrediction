# NumberSequencePrediction

Number Sequence Prediction:

This code predicts an output number sequence given an input number sequence, using Keras Deep Learning Library. The input sequence is passed through an LSTM. A number is generated at each time step.

Example:- For the input [1, 2, 3, 4], the system should predict an output sequence of [2, 3, 4, 5]
